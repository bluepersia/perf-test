**This tool has been tested with small tests. It's now being tested on realistic patterns.**

**Latest update**:

1. Dynamic pseudo selectors support (:hover, :focus, etc.)
2. Inline style override support
3. Special cases - see below.

Welcome to FluidScale, a JS runtime style engine that applies pixel-perfect fluid scaling to your CSS.

Write:

```css
.recipe-card {
  padding: 2rem;
}

@media (min-width: 375px) {
  /* Set the baseline minimum to scale from */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  padding: 4rem;
}
```

And FluidScale will ensure your content scales with screen size.

## 🚀 Usage

In JS:

```js
import fluidScale from 'fluid-scale';

fluidScale();
```

## ⚡ Optimization

By default, FluidScale will scan CSS at runtime.
There are two approaches to optimize the final build.

### 📦 Approach 1: JSON Builder (recommended)

Set up `fluid-scale.config.json` and store it in `public`.

Configure it as JSON, e.g.:

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "homepage": ["src/index.html"],
    "about-us": ["src/about-us.html"]
  },
  "outputDir": "fluid-scale"
}
```

You can also specify CSS files directly.

Make sure you initialize FluidScale with the right JSON ID:

```js
fluidScale({ json: 'homepage' });
```

Once done and you've tested everything in dev mode, build the JSON
`npx fluid-build`

FluidScale will now load asynchronously from JSON while the default values are applied instantly on load.

**Important: JSON output may collide if several people use privately. Kindly ask the team to integrate `npx fluid-build` into the build pipeline - it costs end-users nothing.**

### 🕵️‍♂️ Approach 2: Usage Checks

You can have FluidScale check whether particular content uses FluidScale, and only scan that content.
**Note:** If you're building to and loading from JSON, you can skip this approach.

```js
fluidScale({ checkUsage: true });
```

For linked stylesheets, apply data-fluid attribute:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" data-fluid />
```

For inline styles, add a comment at the very top:

```css
/*enable-fluid*/
```

Now FluidScale will skip the CSS that doesn't have these markers, speeding things up.

## 🧱 Isolation

By default, FluidScale watches the whole DOM to apply itself to any new content.
If the whole team uses FluidScale, this is a solid approach. However, if that's not the case, it may be better to only apply FluidScale to your own content.

```js
const fluidScale = await fluidScale({ autoObserve: false });
```

then

```js
fluidScale.addElements(...parentAndChildren);
```

## 📌 Special Cases

### ⛔ Break

Sometimes you'll want a value to stay locked in place and not scale fluidly.

Apply any of the math functions with just 1 value.
e.g.

```css
calc(4rem)
```

This tells FluidScale to stay at 4rem without scaling, until the next value is defined.

### 🔁 Dynamic Styles (--dynamic: true)

Watches for class/attribute changes on elements.
Automatically re-evaluates which styles to interpolate.

```css
--dynamic: true;
```

### 🌈 Span (--span-start / --span-end)

Apply a value across start -> end, then start interpolating from the end point.

```css
--span-start: all; /* or: font-size, padding-left */
--span-end: all; /* or: font-size, padding-left */
```

### 💪 Force (--force)

FluidScale applies inline styles.

Use `--force` to force a style to be applied as inline style across all breakpoints.

```css
--force: all; /* or: font-size, padding-left */
```

🧠 This puts it at equal level with the interpolated content.

### ✍️ Setting Inline Styles (Manual Overrides)

Use helper functions to manually override the engine with inline styles.

```js
import { setInlineStyle } from 'fluid-scale';

const activeInline = setInlineStyle (el, {
  'margin-top', '5rem',
  'padding', '3rem'
})

activeInline.undo ();
```

## 🌀 Transitions

You can configure the transitions. These are the defaults:

```js
fluidScale({
  autoTransition: { time: 300, easing: 'ease', delay: 0, onlyStart: true },
});
```

`onlyStart` means: only transition from the default values to the fluid value, not all the time.

## 📐 Advanced

If you want more precise control over the default style applied before FluidScale has loaded and applied:

```js
fluidScale({ autoApply: false, minimizedMode: false });
```

For properties with multiple values:

```css
.recipe-card {
  --fluid-padding-min: 2rem 1.5rem;
  --fluid-padding-max: 4rem 3rem;
  padding: var(
    --fluid-padding-value,
    clamp(2rem, 3vw + 1rem, 4rem) clamp(1.5rem, 2vw + 0.8rem, 3rem)
  );
}
```

For single-value properties:

```css
.recipe-card {
  --fluid-font-size: 2rem 4rem;
  font-size: var(--fluid-font-size-value, clamp(2rem, 2vw + 2rem, 4rem));
}
```
